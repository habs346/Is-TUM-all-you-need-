TuM is a highly-ranked university located in a city I am unfamiliar with, enjoying an excellent academic reputation worldwide.

However, academic reputation alone does not guarantee educational excellence. This project, inspired by [CS Self-Learning Guide](https://csdiy.wiki/en/), aims to collect high-quality self-learning materials that complement TuM lectures.
